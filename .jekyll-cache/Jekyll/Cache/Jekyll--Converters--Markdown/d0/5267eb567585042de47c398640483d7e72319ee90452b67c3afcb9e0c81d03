<p>Did you know that â€œCourse cart requestsâ€ will disappear after the second day of course registration? After the implementation of the â€œcourse cartâ€ system, you can freely add courses to cart on the first and second days. But on the third day, only courses that are no more than will be confirmed and courses with more than quota will be withheld and will not be able to see a number of people who have added the courses on their cart. Because of this, many students were confused about how to decide the order of enrollment when the cart system was first implemented.</p>
