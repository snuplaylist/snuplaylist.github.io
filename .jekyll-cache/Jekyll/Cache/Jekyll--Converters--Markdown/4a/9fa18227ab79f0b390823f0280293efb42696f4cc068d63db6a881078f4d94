I"¨<p>You may have a lot of difficulties interacting with Korean students while attending school and writing reports in Korean. Within SNU, college programs, counseling centers and writing centers, international offices and OIA are helping foreign students adapt to college life and classes. In this article, we would like to introduce such programs.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/programs/ctl.png" alt="CTL Writing Program" /></p>

<p>This is a program for foreign students who can receive accurate management of Korean and guidance on how to write for assignments related to class. Tutors do not directly modify the student‚Äôs writing, but modify their own writing based on the tutor‚Äôs guidance and advice.</p>

<p>For undergraduate students, the amount of guidance they can receive for one consultation is limited to less than 10 pages. For graduate students, guidance on degree papers or articles on pages 5 or more should be used for graduate student counseling. Currently, due to COVID-19, all consultations except e-mail consultations are operated as non-face-to-face zoom video consultations. For the current semester, conseling on the same day is not available, so reservations must be made in advance on the site.</p>
