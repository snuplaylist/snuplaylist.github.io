Are you having a hard time studying Korean? Our survey found that many foreign students are having trouble with learning Korean. Even though the classes are conducted in English, there must have been difficulties in your daily life or communication with friends due to insufficient Korean skills. However, there are many people who don't know where and how to learn Korean even though they want to. Therefore, I would like to introduce the Korean Language Education Center(KLEC) program of Seoul National University Language Education Institute(LEI) to those people!

The Korean Language Education Center, which has a history of 52 years, aims to educate foreigners who want to learn Korean to speak fluent and accurate Korean and understand Korean culture. The center's Korean language education program focuses on improving integrated language skills through various learning activities, and aims to improve Korean communication skills by applying optimal teaching methods suitable for individual students. It also provides students with opportunities to experience various Korean cultures.

## Program Details

There are regular and special courses in the programs of KLEC. Regular classes are operated in spring, summer, fall, and winter semester, and are consist of Level 1 to 6 and ‘Advanced Academic Class’ according to student’s Korean level. Level 1 class is for students who have never learn Korean before, and ‘Advanced Academic Class’ is for students who wants to learn advanced Korean skills required in college and graduate classes. Since there are various levels, students can take level tests and take classes that suit their skills without worrying about their basic Korean skills. Hereby is the level description for each level at SNU LEI.
