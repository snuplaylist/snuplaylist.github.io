## Alien Register Card(외국인 등록증)
All foreigners who are to stay for more than 90 days must complete alien registration within 90 days of arrival to Korea.

For any kind of inquiries on your alien registration and sojourn status, you can contact the immigration office directly through calling [1345](tel:1345) (without area code).

Please carefully note that takes about 6 weeks for the Alien Registration Card (ARC) to be issued and you cannot leave Korea before you obtain the card. It is thus recommended that you obtain a Certificate of Alien Registration (외국인등록 사실증명서) after you apply at the immigration office (fee: 2,000 KRW). This certificate will temporarily serve as a substitute for your ARC and can be used for academic affairs until you formally receive your ARC. However, please note that the Certificate of Alien Registration cannot be used to open a Korean bank account or be used to sign in for mobile phone subscriptions.

## Leave of absence
SNU international student who takes a Leave of Absence(휴학) or No Leave of Absence(미휴학파견/participating on an exchange program outside of Korea) will be deemed to have stopped their study in Korea. This change in the student status must be reported to the Immigration Office by the OIA. You must leave Korea **within 30 days from the date of occurrence.**

Upon your report of the occurrence, your authorized length of stay will be automatically shortened regardless of the period printed on your visa or the dates printed on your ARC. Furthermore, your ARC will be voided based on the change in your alien registration. You must turn in your ARC at the international airport when you depart from Korea.

To reenter Korea, you must acquire a new student visa (D-2), which in turn means that you need a new Certificate of Admission. When you apply for a new student visa, please contact the OIA for a Certificate of Admission. As you have turned in your ARC at the international airport upon your departure, you must apply for a new one upon your return to Korea.

**Notes**:

- If your period of sojourn remains less than a year, you are exempted from re-entry permit for the remaining period.
