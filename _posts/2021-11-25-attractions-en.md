Have you ever thought that you want to leave the campus and go somewhere during breaks, weekends, or vacations? Not far from Seoul National University campus, there are wonderful natural scenery and tourist attractions. We would like to introduce some of the many tourist attractions. Take pictures, eat delicious food, and make memories in Seoul!

## 1. Mt. Gwanak
The first place to introduce is Gwanaksan Mountain, which surrounds Seoul National University. As the campus is located in the middle of Gwanaksan Mountain, you can observe the changes of the four seasons wherever you look. You can see cherry blossoms in spring, green forests in summer, colorful autumn leaves in autumn, and snowy mountains in winter.

There are many ways to climb Gwanaksan Mountain. First, there is a route starting from the meeting square between the main gate of Seoul National University and Samsung High School. There is a store or restaurant bathroom near the meeting square, so please simply bring water and snacks before hiking. To reach the top of the mountain, you have to go straight from the 3rd Kkalttak Pass through the valley and steep stairs, so be careful!

Second, I would like to explain the shortest and easiest course to Yeonjudae, the summit of Gwanaksan Mountain. You can get off at SNU Institute of Construction and Environment Engineering if you take bus 5516 at Exit 3 of Sillim Station, bus 5511 or 5513 at Exit 3 of Seoul National University Station, and bus Gwanak 02 at Exit 4 of Nakseongdae Station. It has the advantage of taking less time and length of the course because you can climb from the middle of the mountain. Instead, there are no or insufficient convenience stores or toilets around, so please prepare in advance before hiking.

## 2. Dorimcheon River
Near the campus, there is a stream where you can cool off, ride a bicycle, or take a walk. It is Dorimcheon Stream in Sillim-dong. Dorimcheon Stream can be seen by taking bus 5516 from school to Sillim-dong or taking 5515 from Exit 3 of Seoul National University Station and getting off at the Seoul Industrial Information School stop.

At the beginning of Dorimcheon Stream, there are fountains and wooden bridges, and near Sillim Intersection, there is a place where you can set up fences to let your dogs play with them free. There are also calligraphy scribbles under the bridge, and there is also an empty lot where you can play basketball in the middle of the river. Various animals and plants, including herons and ducks, can be observed in the river, so please visit if you need healing!

## 3. Yeouido Hangang Park
Chicken and beer at Han River! Have you listened to it? I would like to introduce Yeouido Hangang Park, where you can see cherry blossoms in spring, enjoy the night view of Seoul to avoid the heat in summer, and see the fireworks festival in autumn. To get here from campus, take subway line 2 at Seoul National University Station, transfer to line 5 at Yeongdeungpo-gu Office Station, and get off at exit 3 of Yeouinaru Station.

Hangang Park has various sports facilities and rest facilities, and there is a dock where you can take a Han River cruise ship. You can enjoy a bicycle walk on the bike-only road, or you can cook ramen with an instant ramen machine at a convenience store. In addition to Yeouido, there are Hangang Park in Banpo, Ttukseom, Mangwon, and Nanjido, so please go around Seoul!

## 4. Lotte World Adventure
Did you know that there is a place in Seoul where you can enjoy amusement parks, ice rinks, department stores and musical theaters at once? At Lotte World in Jamsil, you can enjoy cultural content while watching Lotte World Tower, the highest landmark in Seoul. If you take subway line 2 at Seoul National University Station and get off at Jamsil Station, you can go to Lotte World through the underground passage.

Lotte World is available from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., and tickets are available for 54,000 won for adults and 45,000 won for admission after 4 p.m. Magic Pass, where you can enter right away without waiting, sells a limited quantity of 47,000 won for 5 types and 85,000 won for 10 types. Foreign students have to buy a free pass exclusively for foreigners. Please note that you can purchase it cheaply if you discount the official app, credit card, and mobile operator.

Lastly, there are two famous photo spots in Lotte World. One is taken against the backdrop of a castle and the other is against the backdrop of a merry-go-round. Why don't you wear animal headbands or school uniforms and take your best pictures with your friends?

## 5. Gyeongbokgung Palace

Do you want to feel like walking in an old palace on a time machine? In the building forest Seoul, you can find old palaces with a quiet atmosphere everywhere. Among them, Gyeongbokgung Palace is the largest and most culturally important palace as it was in charge of the royal palace of the dynasty during the Joseon Dynasty. To get to Gyeongbokgung Palace, take Subway Line 2 at Seoul National University Station, transfer from Gyodae Station to Line 3, and get off at Gyeongbokgung Station.

If you enter Gwanghwamun, you will find the ticket office. Admission is 3,000 won for foreign students. However, if you wear hanbok, you can enter for free. You can watch it from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in winter, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. in spring and autumn, and from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. in summer. I recommend you to watch the viewing course in the same order as shown in the picture.

At Gyeongbokgung Palace, there are several events where you can experience traditional culture. In Gwanghwamun, you can see the gatekeeper's shift ceremony at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., and there is also a program where you can see court food and the inside of Gyeonghoeru Pavilion for two months a year. Night opening is also held by season, so you can refer to the notice. Please rent hanbok and take pictures on the walls of the palace to feel the atmosphere of Korea!
