## Saving Classes of Interest
Search Courses for SNU CRS and save courses as ‘Class of Interest’. You can use it for pre-course registration and course registration.
## Course registration

- Course cart shopping (Day 1-2): 
You can freely search classes and add it to course cart.
- Course cart confirmation (Day 3): 
Registration will be confirmed after comparing number of course carts and course quota.
    - If the number of course cart(s) is **no more than** course quota, all course carts will be confirmed and shown in course registration list.
    - If the number of course carts **exceeds** course quota, all course carts will be withheld and the course will be designated as “Pending courses”.
- Course registration (Day 4-6): 
First-come-first-served registration for vacancies.

However, **on the Day 1 of First-come-first-served registration (= Day 4 of course registration), registration of “pending courses” will be limited to students added courses to cart.** After day 1, anyone can freely register for vacancies in the courses.

## Course change
- **Delete courses**: Select and Delete courses in the course registration list
