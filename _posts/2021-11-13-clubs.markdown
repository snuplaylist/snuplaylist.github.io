## Hobby
### [Amateur Astronomy Association (AAA)](https://snuaaa.net)
In our club, we observe night sky objects and take pictures of them. We usually use a telescope to observe the moon or the planets in the solar system. We also observe deep sky objects such as nebulae, galaxies or star clusters. For the photo activities, we take pictures of these objects ourselves.

Our activities take place in two different locations in the school. First, the ‘Star Room’ is our club room which is located in the Student’s Hall room 611. This room is always open for club members. Here the ‘Didimdol’ classes take place and you can apply for new recruits. We keep our various observation equipment in our dome. The official name for the dome is ‘KimTaeyoung Memorial Observatory’. This is the place we have our ‘Star Meeting’, and on clear nights members observe the skies freely. 

The ‘Star Meeting’ is held every week at the dome. Even when the meeting is not scheduled, members frequently gather around to take photos or observe night sky objects. Sometimes, the members go to places away from the city to take pictures. Every November, we hold a photo exhibition on campus where club members display photos taken for a year. We also go on a MT every vacation. 

Due to the current COVID-19 situation, the offline club activities are not working out as usual, but ‘Star Meeting’ seminars and ‘Didimdol’ classes are still in progress online via Zoom. At the meeting places where the club members meet offline, we are working on preventive measures such as preparing guest books and disinfection.

New recruits need to take ‘Didimdol’ classes for a semester to learn the basics for amateur astronomy activities. Even if you do not know anything about night sky observations, you can learn one by one with our ‘Didimdol’ classes. We welcome everyone who like stars, who want to learn more about the universe, and who wants to take photos of night sky objects!

Hi! I am Lee Hwecheon, president of Monghwan. I guess you will be more familiar with school life than at the beginning of the semester and seek to entertain and satisfy yourself. I can assure you that Monghwan can be a channel to experience incredible magics and meet new people.

Monghwan is the only magic club in SNU, established in 2001. So if you join us this year in 2021, you will be one of the 21st members. We watch and perform magic shows and also roam around. There is no need to worry if you are not skilled at magic tricks. There are enough exciting activities, and we can also teach you magic tricks anytime you want. 

In Monghwan, you can join various activities. First, we perform magic shows twice a year. Also, in summer, we go to the Busan International Magic Festival(BIMF). In addition, we introduce two simple magic tricks every week in elementary lectures. We have much more activities to hang out with friends. Of course, every participation is voluntary! 

Our activities continue during Social-distancing, though adjusted. We will film videos instead of playing on stage. Also, we will hold elementary lectures through Zoom. You can look forward since many short but exciting magic tricks are prepared. If you want to join us, please call us through the websites and number above. You are welcome anytime, so do not hesitate. I hope we can enjoy fun and incredible magic together. I wish you a happy semester.

- **Friendship match with University of Tokyo**

    We have annual friendship matches with the University of Tokyo in summer vacation. The original on-site event is canceled due to the coronavirus, but we have effectively adapted to the situation by holding online matches last year. We are planning to hold an online friendship match this year as well. We make a lot of memories through this event.

## Study
### [얄라셩 YALA](https://instagram.com/snu_yala_shang)

What we do in Yala is like making a good film. What makes a “good film?” First, good production is a must. Yala aims to produce two good-quality films from scratch every six months. All members, regardless of any previous experience or knowledge, can participate and help produce a masterpiece. Scene-copy, 36-hour production and various film making studies are also ready for the members to study, feel, and share everything related with movie production.

Just good production is not enough-the experience of the audience improves it. Yala provides its members an opportunity to watch and feel a good film through Movie Night. From once-a-week official movie night to guerilla movie night when everyone can suggest any film, the club is ample with satisfying experience of enjoying a good flick. Plus when a good film is on cinemas, we would go out and watch it! After watching, members are free to discuss their opinions and analyses-sometimes with a beer and soju in their hands.

Last but not least, good memories are completed by good company. Yala provides opportunities for the members to mingle and get along with each other. Sadly several activities, especially the regular JIFF visit scheduled at May have been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the club tries to provide alternatives to build and maintain friendship and solidarity among members. 

We just don’t make or watch films-we live in them. YALA is open to everyone interested in movies.

These are some clubs we want to introduce! If you have any questions related to clubs at SNU, please leave a comment down below and we will try our best to answer it!
