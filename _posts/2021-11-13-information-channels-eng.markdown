When you first step into Korea and enter Seoul National University, you will be at a loss what to start with. It will be difficult for you to get information about your own room or visa, and how to take classes and interact at school. In this article, we would like to introduce useful school information channels for foreign students.

## [SNU International Students Association (SISA)](https://snusisa.com)

SNU International Student Association (SISA) was officially founded in March 2007, with the aim of representing the International Student Body at Seoul National University (SNU). Under the broad rubric of representing International Students at SNU, SISA’s main activities have been to communicate and resolve academic and administrative issues, the misunderstanding that occurs due to cultural differences, and social integration problems that International Students face in the process of settling down and studying in Korea. In particular, SISA regularly plans Welcoming Party, International Food Festival, Meet-up, Students Forum, Year End Party, Volunteering, Cultural Trip, etc.

SISA’s club room is located in Room 202, bldg. 67. Also, you can visit the SISA website to get information about campus facilities like cafeterias, restaurants, cafes, CVS, international student-related organizations and clubs.
