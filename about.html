foreign students are facing, we released this webzine. This webzine covers everything you need for

    Hi. I’m currently majoring business and psychology in SNU. I love experiencing new culture, that’s why I joined diversity pioneer internship. When we first start our project, I was really excited. However, reality was different from what I expected. Since conducting an interview with foreigners and making an English webzine was new to us, we had a lot of trial and error. After almost three month’s hard work, we finally made our webzine for foreign students in SNU. I really appreciate our teammate’s effort, especially Minh, who really worked hard with all the computer works. I hope this webzine is helpful. Thanks for visiting our webzine and have a great day!
